# My Facebook Clone

Check it out: [Live Demo](https://skeanster.github.io/facebook-clone-react/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What this is:

At time of writing this, this is one of my first experiences working with a baas like Firebase.
It was slow going at first, but after a while I really started to see the power of combining products like React and Firebase.

## Features:

Sign in with Google account or as a guest, add new posts, like posts, add comments, change your username. If you choose to sign in with Google, this app will always remember which posts you have liked, and what your username is.

## What I learned:

Managing React state in combination with a backend database, good test of my CSS skills, really helped me understand the value of organizing componenets well. Taking my arrays out of local stoarage and putting them on the cloud!
